## 📐 Architecture Diagrams

The following diagrams provide visual representations of the system's architecture and workflows:

To generate the architecture diagrams:

1. Install Graphviz:
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install graphviz
   
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install graphviz
   
   # Windows (using Chocolatey)
   choco install graphviz
   ```

2. Run the diagram generation script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/generate_diagrams.sh
   ```

### System Architecture
